# TeetoDots
Just my hyprland dot files and install script.

WARNING: 
  This repo is for my personal use and but feel welcome to use dotfiles or modify them to suit your needs.
  However since this repo is mainly used as a way for me to quickly install my hyprland configuration on a new
  system, the install script is made to work for ME and for you particular system you may have to alter the install 
  script.
