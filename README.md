# TeetoDots
Just my hyprland dot files and install script.

WARNING: 
  This repo is for my personal use but feel welcome to use these dotfiles or modify them to suit your needs.
  However, since this repo is mainly used as a way for me to quickly install my hyprland configuration on a new
  system, the install script is made to work for ME and for you particular system you may have to alter it or write 
  your own.

DISCLAIMER:
  Many of my configurations were inspired or are directly copy of ones I found online, if you feel I have stole any
  of your creative work, or dislike your codes appearance here please leave an issue and I will be happy to remove it.
  (I have made my best effort of leaving watermarks at the top of the files if there was one when I found it.)
